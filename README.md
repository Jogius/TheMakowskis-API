# TheMakowskis API
> A PHP API that exposes endpoints to create and read data from a database.

## Instructions

To use this API, you need to have a server running MySQL, PHP (tested with version 8.0) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Copy the contents of [src](https://github.com/Jogius/TheMakowskis-API/tree/master/src) to a directory of your choice and run 
```bash
composer install
```

Additionally, copy the .env.example files to new files named ``.env`` in the same directory and add the database connection details.
